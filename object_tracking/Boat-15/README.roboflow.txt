The dataset includes 2174 images.
Boat are annotated in YOLOv9 format.

The following pre-processing was applied to each image:
* Auto-orientation of pixel data (with EXIF-orientation stripping)
* Resize to 640x640 (Stretch)

The following augmentation was applied to create 2 versions of each source image:
* 50% probability of horizontal flip
* Randomly crop between 0 and 30 percent of the image
* Random brigthness adjustment of between -25 and +25 percent
